			<h1><u>INTRODUCTION</u></h1>
			<br>
		<p>The organization has given dedicated and relentless service to all types of sick and injured animals. Approximately 9000 to 10000 animals are treated in a year out of which 300 to 400 are always in-patients. Our organization is registered with the Charity Commissioner; Registration No. F-304 (BOM) dated 2nd June 1953 under the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950.

<p>The Royal Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (UK) was founded on 16th June 1824 by the Rev Arthur Broome, Richard Martin and a few others humanitarians. At that time, the concept of animal welfare was ridiculed upon, brutality being commonplace. The only law for the protection of animals was Martin's Act passed in 1822. Though the first of its kind in the world, it only applied to horses and cattle. In 1835, Queen Victoria became a patron of the RSPCA and animals entering the society's portals have been mothered since. As news of this humanitarian work spread, country after country founded their respective SPCAs, all patterned on the RSPCA. Hence the BSPCA came into being and has continued its work towards animal welfare ever since.0</p><br>
